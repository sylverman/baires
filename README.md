Just a code challange

1. Clone this repository to your local.
2. Open your terminal in your project folder and run

```shell
npm install
```
Make sure you have already installed node.js and npm.

3. Type and enter the following command in your terminal.

```shell
grunt
```

4. Then run the index.html file. No additional cofigurations are required.

Due to lack of time, this is not yet fully tested on all devices and browsers, so minor issues are expected (nothing relevant).

Enjoy it!
